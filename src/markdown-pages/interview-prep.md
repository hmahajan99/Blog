Preparing for technical interviews can be tough given the vast amount of online resources available. Been there. Donâ€™t worry, this article will give you an overview on how to kickstart your preparation. 

*This article's focus is mainly on college students.*

### Getting an interview call 
If you are in a Tier-1 or Tier-2 college many companies will be visiting your campus. Make sure to maintain a decent **CGPA** as many companies use this as an eligibility criteria for their online tests. If you are not from one of these colleges or want to apply off campus, the best way to get an interview call is through a **referral**. So grow your network by attending meets/conferences, connecting with people on LinkedIn etc. Also keep visiting the **career websites** of the companies you wish to apply to and keep a lookout for their **online hiring competitions**. Maintain a tab of all the companies you have applied and the status of your application as it is easy to get lost in the process.

### Preparing for the interviews
* **Data Structures and Algorithms :** Undoubtedly the most important part of a technical interview. Most of the times this will be the only thing that matters. Make sure you are thorough with all the standard data structures and algorithms. Be familiar with the standard interview questions as often times these questions are repeated and form the basis to solve other more complex questions. InterviewBit is a great resource for this! Practice coding questions on a whiteboard/paper as this is how you will be expected to code in an interview(no IDE!). 
* **Projects :** Build a couple of projects on which you can talk at length. Some popular fields are web development,  mobile app development (Android/iOS/Hybrid), machine learning and game development. Remember building one complex project is better than building 10 simple unimpressive projects. 
* **CS Fundamentals :** Study theoretical and practical aspects of Operating Systems, DBMS, OOPS and Computer Networks.
* **System Design :** This is generally not asked for entry level interviews, but can pop up sometimes.  
* **Mock Interviews :** Take part in coding contests to improve your speed. Practice mock interviews with a friend or on InterviewBit.
